# AutoJs6-Plugin-Yolo-NCNN: repository rules

These rules apply to this existing plugin. They implement the workspace's AutoJs6 plugin repository specification for its actual Android/native capabilities.

## Working tree and commits

- Read `git status --short`, branch, recent commits and relevant diffs before editing. Preserve pre-existing work and check nested AGENTS.md. Do not stage another task's files or partial changes.
- Use Conventional Commits. Before every commit set `VERSION_BUILD` to `git rev-list --count HEAD` plus one; after committing verify it equals the reachable HEAD count. Do not increment it during builds.
- SemVer describes user-visible compatibility. Update all ten changelog JSON sources for runtime fixes and improvements, then regenerate documentation.
- Local signing material, local.properties, generated APKs and migration backup files are ignored and must never be committed or logged.

## Build and release

- Root project name is `autojs6-plugin-yolo-ncnn`. Use the publicly published platform-versions and native-alignment plugins at 1.8.1; no local plugin override, mavenLocal, consumer gradle/data, or sibling JAR/AAR dependency.
- Apply platform-versions in root settings before build-logic. Root Android/Kotlin plugin versions consume the platform's system properties. Use AGP's built-in Kotlin support and UTF-8 compilation.
- SDK, package version and JDK inputs come from version.properties and build-logic. Builds must not rewrite tracked version inputs.
- Python 3.10+ and Android SDK build tools are required for release validation. `:app:appendDigestToReleasedFiles` depends on `assembleRelease` and validates the configured release variant/ABI matrix, actual APK identities, release certificate, 64-bit ELF/ZIP alignment and CRC32 before archiving to `releases/v<VERSION_NAME>/`.
- Derive ABI splits from android.defaultConfig.ndk.abiFilters so the committed single-ABI configuration and optional multi-ABI worktree remain valid. Keep signed universal and single-ABI outputs for every multi-ABI release flavor. The release helper refuses stale APKs, incomplete matrices, unknown files and unmanaged destination directories. Legacy Android Studio `app/release` and `app/releases` directories are not release inputs.
- The native inventory must agree with getInfo() for the actual installed APK. Do not infer release readiness from source files or a different version's APK.

## Activation and metadata

- Services: .YoloPluginInfoService, .provider.YoloProviderService. Discovery actions: org.autojs.plugin.INFO, org.autojs.plugin.YOLO. Preserve their existing public action/category/AIDL contracts and host capability negotiation.
- Wake Activity must resolve from `org.autojs.plugin.WAKE_ACTIVITY`, be exported, protected by `org.autojs.permission.PLUGIN`, use Theme.NoDisplay, respond to the WAKE action plus DEFAULT category, and finish immediately.
- PluginInfo must expose the English app label, localized description, PackageInfo version, actual APK ABI inventory, plugin identity, build date and minimum host capability.
- Validate input bounds and error propagation; close file descriptors and native resources deterministically. Keep host entry points and public contracts compatible.

## Resources and documentation

- English titles and identity strings are untranslatable. Keep default English and explicit values-en equal, with complete ar/es/fr/ja/ko/ru/zh-Hans/zh-Hant-HK/zh-Hant-TW resources.
- Sort strings by name, separate untranslatable resources and plurals, use ASCII punctuation and `...` with TypographyEllipsis suppression. Descriptions have no terminal punctuation or unnecessary host-specific preamble.
- Maintain the plugin's actual PNG icon at app/src/main/res/mipmap/ic_launcher.png.
- Edit .readme/.changelog JSON and templates, then run the generator and its read-only check. Root README is the same Simplified Chinese source as README-zh-Hans.md. Changelogs are generated under assets/doc.
- Keep third-party provenance/license/hash records synchronized with native/API/model changes. A settings or updater UI must link to bundled localized release history.

## Verification

```powershell
python .python/generate_markdown.py --check
python -m unittest discover -s .python -p test_release_archive.py
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 '-Djava.vendor=Eclipse Adoptium' '-Djava.vendor.version=Temurin-21.0.12.1+1' :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest :app:lintDebug
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:appendDigestToReleasedFiles
```

`Unflavored` is the representative Debug build; release validation always checks all configured flavors. Run instrumentation on a compatible host/device for discovery, binding, getInfo, actual native/Binder happy paths, invalid input, rebind and cleanup. Verify every published ABI. Exercise arm64 and x86_64 when those ABIs are shipped, and a 16 KB device where supported. ColorOS activation and device tests require explicit evidence; compiling tests or checking ELF alignment does not establish a device pass. Record any missing device/flavor coverage in the release assessment.

The legacy R6 source gate deliberately requires an unsigned clean checkout without local signing material. Its APK content checks select the universal artifact when splits exist. Use appendDigestToReleasedFiles for the signed release matrix in a signing-enabled checkout; do not treat the unsigned R6 receipt as formal distribution evidence.
